# Infant-Pose-pytorch

### Introduction  
Apply OpenPose and Infant Key-point Dataset to Evaluate Infant Posture. This is a NYU course project for CSCI-GA 3033 Section: 091 Introduction to Deep Learning Systems (Spring 2021)  
In this project, we will use CMU's famous model Openpose to do some experiment based on a self-labeled infant posture dataset.
